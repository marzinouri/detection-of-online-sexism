# Detection of Online Sexism - SemEval 2023 Task 10

This GitHub repository contains a baseline implementation for the detection of online sexism in English social media posts. The project is part of the SemEval 2023 Task on Online Sexism Detection, which involves three subtasks: Subtask A involves the detection of sexism, Subtask B categorizes such posts into four coarse-grained sexism categories, and Subtask C further refines the categorization into eleven fine-grained subcategories.

## Overview

The baseline approach in this repository leverages TF-IDF vectors in combination with Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression for the task of online sexism detection. The primary goal of this baseline is to provide a starting point for tackling this challenging problem.

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset used in this project may have class imbalance issues, and I have addressed this by employing downsampling and upsampling techniques to balance the dataset.
